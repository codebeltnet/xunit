# Extensions for xUnit by Codebelt

Originally, this project was part of **Cuemon for .NET**, but with the forthcoming release of .NET 9, it was split into its own project. This project is now part of **Extensions for xUnit by Codebelt**.

[Cuemon for .NET](https://www.cuemon.net/) will pursue its original purpose; providing a complemental framework / sidecar to .NET.

Proceed to the [docs](/api/Codebelt.Extensions.Xunit.html).
